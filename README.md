HERE A SHORT PARAGRAPH DESCRIBING HOW YOU PERFORMED THE TASK

To create the interactive quiz application, I used HTML to structure the layout, including elements like questions, answer options, and navigation buttons. CSS was applied to style the interface, ensuring it was visually appealing and user-friendly. JavaScript was used to handle the quiz logic, such as displaying questions, checking user answers, updating the score, and navigating between questions. Event listeners were implemented to make the application responsive to user input, and the quiz results were shown dynamically at the end based on the user's performance.
